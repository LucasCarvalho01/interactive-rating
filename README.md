## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI).


Solution completed using pure HTML, CSS and JS. Practiced mainly envent listeners on this, and interacted with forms and local storage. Cool one!
